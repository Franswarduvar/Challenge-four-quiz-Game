# Challenge-four-quiz-Game
The goal of this project was to develop an nteractive quiz game.
A game where the user took a quiz, answered multiple choice questions and depending on the answers given gets a score.
The scorring system saves in local storage then presents it to a highscore page. 
The user has the ability to erase all scores saved along with their initials that they placed inside.

This project tought me the importance of nailing down variable and ID names. More then once my code stopped working because names and ID's did not match. In my future projects I will sit down and write out all ID's, variables and titles that need to be referenced accorss different documents.
